🏥 Patient Data Modeling & ETL Insights
A Complete Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Patient Data Modeling & ETL Insights repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end Data Warehouse and Analytics pipeline built using industry-standard data engineering practices. It covers everything from data modeling, ETL pipeline development, and data quality checks, to building a multi-layer data warehouse (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and generating meaningful healthcare insights.

🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Hospital Patient Analytics System, where raw patient, doctor, visit, and diagnosis data flows through multiple transformation stages before becoming clean, standardized, and analysis-ready.

The workflow follows the Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer → Raw ingested data from CSV (patients, doctors, visits, diagnosis)

Silver Layer → Cleaned & standardized data (deduplication, type casting, joins)

Gold Layer → Dimensional modeling with Fact & Dimension tables

Analytics Layer → SQL views for insights (patient trends, doctor performance, visit patterns)
